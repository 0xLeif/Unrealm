// MARK: - Notifications
extension StorageResults {
    /**
     Registers a block to be called each time the collection changes.
     
     The block will be asynchronously called with the initial results, and then called again after each write
     transaction which changes either any of the objects in the collection, or which objects are in the collection.
     
     The `change` parameter that is passed to the block reports, in the form of indices within the collection, which of
     the objects were added, removed, or modified during each write transaction. See the `RealmCollectionChange`
     documentation for more information on the change information supplied and an example of how to use it to update a
     `UITableView`.
     
     At the time when the block is called, the collection will be fully evaluated and up-to-date, and as long as you do
     not perform a write transaction on the same thread or explicitly call `realm.refresh()`, accessing it will never
     perform blocking work.
     
     Notifications are delivered via the standard run loop, and so can't be delivered while the run loop is blocked by
     other activity. When notifications can't be delivered instantly, multiple notifications may be coalesced into a
     single notification. This can include the notification with the initial collection.
     
     For example, the following code performs a write transaction immediately after adding the notification block, so
     there is no opportunity for the initial notification to be delivered first. As a result, the initial notification
     will reflect the state of the Realm after the write transaction.
     
     ```swift
     let results = realm.objects(Dog.self)
     print("dogs.count: \(dogs?.count)") // => 0
     let token = dogs.observe { changes in
     switch changes {
     case .initial(let dogs):
     // Will print "dogs.count: 1"
     print("dogs.count: \(dogs.count)")
     break
     case .update:
     // Will not be hit in this example
     break
     case .error:
     break
     }
     }
     try! realm.write {
     let dog = Dog()
     dog.name = "Rex"
     person.dogs.append(dog)
     }
     // end of run loop execution context
     ```
     
     You must retain the returned token for as long as you want updates to be sent to the block. To stop receiving
     updates, call `invalidate()` on the token.
     
     - warning: This method cannot be called during a write transaction, or when the containing Realm is read-only.
     
     - parameter block: The block to be called whenever a change occurs.
     - returns: A token which must be held for as long as you want updates to be delivered.
